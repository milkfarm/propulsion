      %p <em>Propulsion</em> is a small development team that thrives on the creative process. Over the course of our careers, we have developed solutions for Société Général de Surveillance, Petroconsulants (now IHS Energy Group), Discount Bank &amp; Trust Company, Banque Piguet, and Firmenich, among others. Today, we apply that accumulated knowledge to the unique challenges in the book publishing industry.

      %h1 Dedicated craftmanship
      %p Successfully implementing new ideas requires careful attention to details. In practical terms, we analyze business systems, develop improvements and then relentlessly iterate. We apply this same process to straight-forward static sites or complex business-to-business applications. For examples of our work, refer to #{link_to 'our recent client list', '/clients.html', class: 'more'} or #{link_to 'contact us directly', '/contact.html'}.
